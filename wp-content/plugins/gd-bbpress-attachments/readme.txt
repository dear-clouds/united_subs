Implements attachments upload to the topics and replies in bbPress plugin through media library and adds additional forum based controls.

== Description ==
Attachments for forum topics and replies are handled through WordPress media library. You can control file sizes from the main plugin settings panel, or you can do it individually for each forum you have set. You can limit number of files user can attach for each topic and reply. Plugin can embed list of attached files into topics and replies, and images can be displayed as thumbnails. All upload errors are logged and topic/reply author and administrators can see those errors.

On admin side, topic and reply panels have column with attachments count, and on the individual edit pages you will see meta box with list of attachments and upload errors.

Supported languages: English, Serbian, Swedish, Polish, Dutch, German, Italian, Slovak, French, Spanish, Persian, Portuguese.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
* Where can I configure the plugin?
Open the Forums menu, and you will see Attachments item there. This will open a panel with global plugin settings.

* What are the common problems that can prevent upload to work?
In some cases, it can happen that jQuery is not included in the page, even so the bbPress requires it to be loaded. That can happen if something else is unloading jQuery. If the jQuery is not present, upload will not work.
Other common issue is that WordPress Media Library upload is not working. If that is not set up, attachments upload can't work.

* Why is Media Library required?
All attachments uploads are handled by the WordPress Media Library, and plugin uses native WordPress upload functions. When file is uploaded it will be available through Media Library. Consult WordPress documentation about Media Library requirements.

* Will this plugin work with standalone bbPress instalation?
No. This plugin requires the plugin versions of bbPress 2.3 or higher.

* Does this plugin work with bbPress that is part of BuddyPress plugin?
No. Plugin requires bbPress 2.3 or higher plugin.

* Does this plugin work with bbPress plugin used as site wide forums for BuddyPress plugin?
