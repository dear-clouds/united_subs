= Use Wiki to create... =
* A WordPress based Wiki site
* Multiple Wiki sites on a WordPress MultiSite install - so any user of your site can have their own Wiki.
 
= Wiki Pro = 
Wiki supports creating and editing Wikis by users who can edit posts in your blog. Users can edit the Wiki from the frontend as well as the Admin Dashboard. For extended functionality look at <a href='http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/wordpress-wiki'>Wiki Pro</a>.
 
Wiki Pro includes: 
 
* **Allow anyone** to edit wikis from front end 
* **Allow anyone from the network** to edit wikis 
* **Allow site users** to edit wikis

= How does it work... well, it's really easy. =

Simply follow the instructions in the installation and configuration guide

You'll then be able to create Wikis from the Admin Dashboard. After the first Wiki is created users with post editing capabilities can create sub-Wikis from the frontend.

We have put together an in-depth <a href='http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/wordpress-wiki/installation/'>instruction guide</a> to help you through using standard WordPress categories to mark posts / content as being accessible to either free users or members only, and then go into some of the more advanced features that allow you to protect individual uploads and distinct sections of a posts content.
