This calendar plugin is created based on WordPress core standards. This means that each calendar/event is a custom post, the category is taxonomy and standard tags are applicable for each post. Thus the Event Calendar WD fully inherits the user and SEO-friendly standards of WordPress.
 
The Event calendar WD is responsive and runs very smoothly on all devices. Thus the site visitors will get a pleasant user experience when viewing the calendars using various mobile devices and tablets.
 
The color scheme of the event calendar is based on the theme and the category colors. To get access to the theme section of the calendar you need to purchase the Pro version of the Event calendar WD. In free version of the Event Calendar WD you can add colors to event categories. The events will display with the background color prescribed by the category.
 
Don't want the user to leave the event calendar page without knowing the details of the interesting events? Well, the calendar plugin uses Ajax load for the events and all event details of the calendar are being displayed on hover.
 
The events should be repeated? Feel free to use the recurring option choosing the repeating period on your own. So you can easily manage recurring events with this event calendar. Note that this is an Event Calendar WD pro feature.
 
You can choose a venue for each event and mark up the location on Google Maps and display all of this on the event calendar. Whenever creating new events you have options of selecting from previously created venues, or to create a new venue. The Google Map integration helps to display the scaled option of the map. This will ensure that your guests will get full directions and never miss an event.
 
Need to mention the hosts of the event? The Event Calendar WD plugin uses organizer section for this exact purpose. The number of the organizers is not limited. The calendar events can be hosted by multiple organizers.

The Event Calendar WD can be also used as an integral part of your site, not simply as a plugin. Since the event calendars are being created as a custom post, there is a possibility to display the event calendars among the standard post listings such as related posts or latest posts.

Calendar Themes

The Event Calendar WD comes with 5 themes. In addition to the original Event Calendar themes, there is a possibility to add a new calendar theme based on the Blue(Default) theme option. Here you can change the look of the theme- colors, font sizes, borders and etc. The newly created calendar theme will be saved as a separate theme and you can use it while creating new event calendars. The calendar themes are divided in subsections and apply to either the Event Calendar views or the widgets.

Publishing the Calendar into a Page/Post

To use the created calendars within a page or post you should use the shortcode. In this sense the Event Calendar plugin is similar to the other WP plugins.
Open the page/post from the back end. Press on the  Event Calendar WD icon within the editor. The calendar shortcode with three tabs will appear. An alternative is copying the calendar shortcode from the All Calendars subsection (it will take default settings) and further editing it.
