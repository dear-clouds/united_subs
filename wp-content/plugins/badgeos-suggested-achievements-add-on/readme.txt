Enhances sites running BuddyPress and BadgeOS by suggesting next possible incomplete achievements that a user can earn.

== Description ==

A widget that allows the site creator to display badge activities or achievements available to be completed.  As activities are completed they are removed from the list.

Site participants have a perpetual view of achievements still to be completed.  Using a widget, this is an easy way for administers to guide participants to new activities.

**Note:** You will need to install the free [BadgeOS plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badgeos/ "BadgeOS")&trade; (version 1.4.8 or higher) to use the BadgeOS Community Add-on. You will also need the [BuddyPress plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress/ "BadgeOS") v1.7 or higher installed.

[Get the BadgeOS plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badgeos/ "BadgeOS").

[BadgeOS](http://badgeos.org "BadgeOS")&trade; turns your WordPress site into an achievement, badging and engagement management system. Your users complete steps, demonstrate skills and knowledge, and earn digital badges. Easily define the achievements, organize the badge requirements any way you like, and choose from and combine a range of assessment options to determine whether each task or requirement has been achieved.

Create badges and set up the achievements to earn them. Badges are Mozilla OBI compatible and sharable via [Credly](https://credly.com/ "Credly.com"), the free web service for managing and displaying lifelong credentials.

= Where should I contribute code back to the project? =

Thanks for asking!  Please do share back code modifications or enhancements you make for inclusion in BadgeOS core or as add-ons. (Functions that are specialized for just some users are likely best as add-on plugins to BadgeOS. We can help figure that out with you.) Visit us on [GitHub](https://github.com/opencredit/badgeos "BadgeOS on GitHub") to share your code with the BadgeOS community.

= Credly is really cool. How can I learn more about it? =

[Credly](https://credly.com/ "Credly web site") is the universal way to recognize, store and share life's achievements. We've integrated Credly into BadgeOS because it's downright the easiest, most fun way to collect evidence of all your achievements in one place and then share them out when and where it matters most. There are a rapidly growing number of platforms and apps that are using the Credly "Open Credit" API to enable sharable badges; the BadgeOS WordPress integration is just one great example! Visit us [Credly.com](https://credly.com "Credly on the Web") to learn more or [contact](https://credly.com/contact "Contact us") us for guidance with using the free Open Credit API in your own projects or applications.
