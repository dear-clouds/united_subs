 * that the notice will be delayed by after first installation date. This date is determined by an option created
 * during plugin activation, if not already present. When retrieving this value, if it does not exist
 * (perhaps because this update was installed after activation happened), it will be deduced from the creation time
 * of the oldest feed source. If no feed sources exist, the time at that moment will be determined as the
 * first activation time from that point onward.
