WP RSS Aggregator is the most comprehensive RSS feed importer and autoblogging plugin for WordPress with premium add-ons for additional functionality.

WP RSS Aggregator is the original and best plugin for easily importing, merging and displaying RSS and Atom feeds on your WordPress site. It’s the most comprehensive and elegant RSS feed solution for WordPress.

With the free core version of WP RSS Aggregator you will be able to aggregate as many RSS feeds from as many sources as you'd like, with the ability to stagger them for better performance.
Using the [shortcodes](http://docs.wprssaggregator.com/shortcodes/) you can then display the imported feed items from one or more sources anywhere on your WordPress site.

### NOTES ###
The core WP RSS Aggregator plugin is free to download from the WordPress.org plugin repository.
The plugin works on self-hosted versions of WordPress only (WordPress.org). It is not compatible with the hosted version
of WordPress (WordPress.com). [Click here](https://www.wpmayor.com/differences-between-wordpressorg-and-wordpresscom/) if you're not sure about the difference between the two.

Terms & conditions can be found [here](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/terms-conditions/).

== Installation ==

Follow these instructions to install and set up the core WP RSS Aggregator plugin:

> 1. Download the plugin from the “Download” button above.
> 2. Upload the `wp-rss-aggregator` zip file to your site's `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
> 3. Activate the WP RSS Aggregator plugin from the 'Plugins' section in your dashboard.
> 4. Configure the plugin by going to the `RSS Aggregator` menu item that appears in your dashboard menu.
> 5. Set up your [feed sources](https://docs.wprssaggregator.com/adding-a-feed-source-importing-as-feed-items/) and [general settings](https://docs.wprssaggregator.com/general-plugin-settings/).
> 6. Use the WP RSS Aggregator shortcode in your posts and/or pages to display the imported feed items: `[wp-rss-aggregator]`

Alternatively, you can find our plugin through your WordPress dashboard:

> 1. Go to the Plugins section in your WordPress site's dashboard.
> 2. Click the "Add New" button.
> 3. Search for "WP RSS Aggregator".
> 4. When found, click on the "Install" button, then hit the "Activate" button once it has installed.
> 5. Set up your [feed sources](https://docs.wprssaggregator.com/adding-a-feed-source-importing-as-feed-items/) and [general settings](https://docs.wprssaggregator.com/general-plugin-settings/).
> 6. Use the WP RSS Aggregator shortcode in your posts and/or pages to display the imported feed items: `[wp-rss-aggregator]`

You can easily select the source for your feeds and also insert a limit via
[shortcode parameters](http://docs.wprssaggregator.com/shortcodes/#core-parameters) as shown below.
To get your feed source ID simply hover over the required feed source in the feed source listing page. It will appear beneath the name.

`[wp-rss-aggregator source=”ID” limit=”num”]`

An example of a shortcode parameter in use could be:

`[wp_rss_aggregator link_before='li class="feed-link"' link_after='/li']`

It is advisable to use the 'HTML' view of the editor when inserting shortcodes with parameters.

__Usage within theme files__

Here are two examples of a function call from within the theme's files:
`
<?php 
wprss_display_feed_items( $args = array(
	'links_before' => '<ul>',
	'links_after' => '</ul>',
	'link_before' => '<li>',
	'link_after' => '</li>',
	'limit' => '8',
	'source' => '5,9'
	)); 
?>
`

OR 

`<?php do_shortcode('[wp-rss-aggregator]'); ?>`


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I display the imported feed items? =

You can either use the shortcode in your posts and pages:
`[wp-rss-aggregator]`

Or you can call the function directly within your theme:
`<?php wprss_display_feed_items(); ?>`

- - -

= Is there a limit on the number of feed sources I can use? =

No, there is no limit for the number of feed sources. Having many (50+) feed sources should not present any problems in itself.
However, pulling in posts from many sites is bound to put your server under some stress, so you might want to consider using a hosting solution that goes beyond your typical shared host. 

Check out our dedicated page on [WordPress hosting](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/recommended-web-hosts/) recommendations.

- - -

= Does WP RSS Aggregator work using JSON as the source? =

No, our plugin does not currently import from JSON, it only imports from RSS and Atom structured XML.

- - -

= Why do I get “No feed items found” when I insert the shortcode on a page or post? =

1. Try adding a few more feed sources and make sure they are valid by using the RSS Feed Validator.

2. Try out the solutions listed on our [Feed Items Not Importing](http://docs.wprssaggregator.com/feed-items-not-importing/) documentation page.

3. It’s important to make sure your WordPress cron system is working well. If not, the feeds cannot be imported.
If in doubt, you can install the WP Crontrol plugin to check for [bad cron](https://docs.wprssaggregator.com/cron-intervals/#bad-cron),
or go to RSS Aggregator > Debugging and hit the red button to re-import all feed items.

If the problems persist, please [contact our support team](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-rss-aggregator).
If you’re using a premium add-on, please use the [premium support channel](https://www.wprssaggregator.com/contact/).

- - -

= Can I store imported feed items as posts? = 

Yes! You can do that with the [Feed to Post](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/extensions/feed-to-post) premium add-on.
You will not only be able to store items as posts, but also as any other custom post type. You can also set the author,
set tags and categories, import images into the gallery or set featured images, and much more.

- - -

= Some RSS feeds only give a short excerpt. Any way around that? =

Yes, along with the [Feed to Post](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/extensions/feed-to-post) add-on we have another add-on
called [Full Text RSS Feeds](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/extension/full-text-rss-feeds/) that can get the full content
of most feeds that only supply a short excerpt. The Full Text RSS Feeds add-on requires Feed to Post and a valid license key to function.

- - -

= I’m not sure which premium add-ons are right for me. Can you help me out? =

Sure! We wrote a [post](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/add-ons-purchase/) just for you. Read about which add-ons
you should buy as we explain the different types of usage so you’ll know what to expect when purchasing.

If you need any further help you can [contact our support team](http://www.wprssaggregator.com/contact/) or try out our
[Simple Feeds Bundle demo](http://simple.wprssaggregator.com/) and [Advanced Feeds Bundle demo](http://demo.wprssaggregator.com/).

- - -

= Where can I find the documentation for the plugin? =

Our complete documentation with FAQs included can be found on our dedicated [documentation website](http://docs.wprssaggregator.com/).
